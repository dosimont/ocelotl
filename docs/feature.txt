How to generate a feature for Ocelotl?

1) Add Ocelotl plug-ins into the feature plug-in:
--------------------------------------------------

  In the plugin fr.inria.soctrace.tools.ocelotl.feature, click on feature.xml.
  In the Plug-ins tab, add all the plug-ins and fragments that are part of Ocelotl.
  
  If fragments containing platform-specific code are added, then specify in the right part the OS and the arch for which they were written for.

2) Generate the feature:
-------------------------

  If exporting multi-platform fragments:
  	Install the delta pack for your version of eclipse (follow the instructions at this address: http://ugosan.org/eclipse-rcp-delta-pack/)
  	IMPORTANT: Do not check Export Source when exporting the feature, otherwise fragments for other platforms than the host platform won't be exported

  Right click on the feature package, Export, Plug-in Development, Deployable features

  In Destination tab
    Select fr.inria.soctrace.tools.ocelotl.feature
    Select Archive file, browse and type a name for the archive

  In Options tab
    Select Export source, Generate source bundles (Note: leave unchecked if exporting multi-platform fragments)
    Select Package as individual Jar archives
      Select Generate p2 repository
      Select Categorize repository, add the file category.xml from the feature
    Select Qualifier replacement, add a value (alpha, beta, rc, or nothing for the final version)

Click on Finish
