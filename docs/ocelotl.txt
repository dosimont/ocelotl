How to use the Ocelotl tool for FrameSoC:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Launch the tool]
	- Go to the FrameSoC menu -> Trace Analysis -> Launch Analysis Tool
        - Select the Ocelotl tool
        - No argument is needed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Trace Selection]
        - In the Trace Overview tab, select a Trace

- [Microscopic Description Settings]
        - The Microscopic Description combo becomes then available:
            - Select "Event Distribution" for an analysis based on the event occurences.
              This type of analysis is compatible with all the traces.
            - Select "State Distribution" for an analysis based on the event duration.
              This analysis requires some specifics types of events (states).
              Some trace formats are not compatible with this analysis.
        - A setting window opens automatically. Choose:
            - The Event Types that are involved in the analysis 
            - The Event Producers (the resources that produce the events) that are 
            involved in the analysis.
              Add Result button enables to load a set of Event Producers saved as an 
              analysis result by an other tool.
            - You may want to configure Advanced Settings.
                - Event Number Retrieved by Threads: enables to configure how much events
                  are loaded by threads for each iteration during the trace reading.
                - Event Producers per Query: enables to divide the query into several queries
                  with a fixed number of Event Producers.
                  This functionnality is useful if the disk space is low, as the temp directory 
                  is used to store the query result during the trace reading.
                  - Working Threads: enables to change the number of active thread during the
                  trace reading.
              Careful, modify these values may decrease the trace reading performances.

- [Visualization Settings]
        - The Visualization combo becomes then available:
            - Select "Parts" for a visualization showing aggregates that corresponds to an
            homogeneous behavior in the trace. The aggregates are separated by a blank space
            and a different color
            Settings: 
              - Aggregate parts : gathers time slices that belong to the same aggregate.
                If not active, each time slice is separated, and their aggregation is shown
                thanks to their color.
                Show part number : attributes a number to each aggregate to help to
                distinguish them.
            - Select "Proportions" for a visualization showing the same aggregates, but also
            the proportion of event occurences (resp. the ratio of state duration) for each 
            aggregate.
            Settings:
              - For each event, you can customize the color

- [Quality Curves]
        - The tab Quality Curves enables to change the apparence of complexity and information
        curves provided by the aggregation algorithm:
            - Normalize Qualities normalizes the curves and scale them to [0:1], which improves
            their reading
            - You may choose rising curves (complexity gain, information gain) or decreasing
            curves (complexity reduction, information loss)

- [Time Settings]
        - You may change the trace time bounds thanks to the Start and End fields on the bottom
        of on the window. Reset enables to get the original value back.
        - Timeslice Number field corresponds to the number of time slices that will be used to
        compute the aggregation. It is adviced to tune this parameter in order to find a
        granularity that is convenient to the analysis. As the aggregation aglorithm complexity
        is dependant on this parameter, it is adviced to incremente it progressively to keep
        good performances.

- [Threshold]
        - This parameter determines the quality curves precision. More its value decreases,
        more the precision increases. However, a too weak value may be responsible of
        bad performances. We advice to keep the default value/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Run an Analysis]
        - After having set the configuration, click on RUN! (or press ENTER on the keyboard)
          The aggregation is then computing. It can take a while.
        - When it is finished, the visualization and the curves are shown.

- [Change the Aggregation strength]
        - In order to find a relevant aggregation, you may tune the parameter. There is three
        ways:
            - Click on the curves. The corresponding parameter is retrieved, and used to show
            the associated aggregation.
            - Use < and > buttons (or use left and right arrow on the keyboard). It enables
            to increment or decrement the parameter.
            - Enter a value manually, in the Paramter field. The value is comprised between
            1 and 0.
        A value of 1 means that the aggregation strength is maximal: all the trace is 
        disaggregated. Convertheless, a value of 0 means that each time slice is disaggregated.
        A intermediate value provides a compromise between both extrema.

- [Zoom]
        - Once you obtain an interesting aggregation level, you may want to focus on a
        particular time area. Select this area by clicking and dragging with the left button of
        your mouse. Then, click on RUN! or press ENTER.

- [Switch to a Gantt Chart (not available in SET 1.0)]
        - If a generic Gantt Chart is available, you can switch to it by clicking on the
        corresponding button on the corner right. The Gantt Chart will show the trace part
        with the time bounds shown in the Start and End fields. You may focus on an area
        by selecting it with the mouse left button drag and then switching directly to the Gantt,
        without loading the aggregation with the RUN! button.


- [Known Issues]
        - You may need to redimension manually the different views, according to your resolution.
