{"name":"Ocelotl Analysis Tool","tagline":"Multidimensional Overviews for Huge Trace Analysis","body":"Ocelotl is an innovative visualization tool, which provides overviews for execution trace analysis by using a data aggregation technique. This technique enables to find anomalies in huge traces containing up to several billions of events, while keeping a fast computation time and providing a simple representation that does not overload the user.\r\n\r\nOcelotl is integrated into [Framesoc](http://soctrace-inria.github.io/framesoc/), a generic trace management and analysis infrastructure. You can take advantage of the tool bunch provided by Framesoc, and switch from an Ocelotl's overview to more detailed representations once you know where to focus.\r\n\r\n![Ocelotl Screenshot](http://soctrace-inria.github.io/ocelotl/images/screenshots/ocelotl_spatiotemporal.png)\r\n\r\nYou will find here a video showing Ocelotl functionalities:\r\n\r\n[![Ocelotl Analysis Tool](http://soctrace-inria.github.io/ocelotl/images/play.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cbLM0rUu78)\r\n\r\n##Get Ocelotl Now!\r\n\r\n### Update Site\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest way to start with Ocelotl.\r\nFirst, [download](https://www.eclipse.org/) a version of Eclipse. We recommand [Eclipse Luna](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Luna/SR2).\r\nThen, install Ocelotl in Eclipse using the following procedure: \r\n\r\n- Go to _Help > Install New Software_. \r\n- Type the following address in the text field _Work with:_\r\n  - http://soctrace-inria.github.io/updatesite/\r\n- Select the feature(s) you want to install\r\n- Press _Next_ and follow the wizard (accept the license and finish the installation).\r\n- At the end of the installation, Eclipse will ask for restart.\r\n\r\n### Quick Setup\r\n- After the restart following a fresh installation, a configuration wizard will automatically pop up to perform the initial configuration.\r\n- If no wizard is shown (because, for example, you already had a `soctrace.conf` configuration file in your Eclipse installation directory), do the following:\r\n  - Launch the Framesoc perspective: _Windows > Open Perspective > Other... > Framesoc_\r\n  - Launch the wizard: _Framesoc > Management > Initialize System_\r\n\r\n### Java Heap Issue\r\nIn order to be able to use Ocelotl you might need to increase the maximum amount of memory available for the JVM, setting it to at least 4096 MB for best performance. To do this, you need to:\r\n- Open the `eclipse.ini` file in the root directory of your eclipse installation\r\n- Look for a line containing the -Xmx variable, like the following:\r\n\r\n  `-Xmx####m` (#### is the current value of maximal memory in MB)\r\n\r\n- Replace #### with at least 4096, in order to get the following line:\r\n\r\n  `-Xmx4096m` \r\n\r\n### Download the Sources\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may want to work with Ocelotl sources.\r\n\r\n[List of releases](https://github.com/soctrace-inria/ocelotl/releases)\r\n\r\nFollow the [wiki](https://github.com/soctrace-inria/ocelotl/wiki/User-Guide) to set a developer environment.\r\n\r\n## Wiki and User Guide\r\n\r\nCheck our [wiki](https://github.com/soctrace-inria/ocelotl/wiki/User-Guide) to install, configure and use Ocelotl.\r\nA detailed [user guide](https://github.com/soctrace-inria/ocelotl/raw/master/docs/ocelotl_userguide.pdf) is also available for more details.\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\n\r\nOcelotl is based on the Eclipse framework and it is released under the [EPL (Eclipse Public License) v1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html). The legal documentation has been written following the guidelines specified [here](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/guidetolegaldoc.php).\r\n\r\n## Support and Contact\r\nYou can contact us by email:\r\n\r\n[Damien Dosimont] (mailto:damien.dosimont-at-imag.fr),\r\n[Youenn Corre] (mailto:youenn.corre-at-inria.fr),\r\n[Generoso Pagano] (mailto:generoso.pagano-at-inria.fr) (replace -at- by @)\r\n\r\nor follow us on [github](https://github.com/soctrace-inria/ocelotl).\r\n\r\n### Ocelotl User List\r\nYou can subscribe to the Ocelotl user list using this [form](http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ocelotl-users)\r\nand post a message to the list members by sending an email to\r\n[ocelotl-users-at-lists.gforge.inria.fr](mailto:ocelotl-users-at-lists.gforge.inria.fr)\r\n","google":"UA-56138567-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
